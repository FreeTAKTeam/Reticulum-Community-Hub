[Dashboard // Mission Control]

Purpose:
This page is the operational overview for the hub. It combines node health, telemetry flow, and backend control in one surface.

Primary systems:
- Backend Control starts, stops, and checks the backend process.
- Global Telemetry Stream visualizes ingest, motion, transport load, and marker activity over the last 24 hours.
- Event Feed shows real-time operational events with expandable metadata.
- Time panel displays local node timing and uptime.

Use this page for quick situational awareness before deeper work in map, users, topics, or file operations.
