[Users // Identity Grid]

Purpose:
This page governs identities, connected users, and routing visibility.

Primary systems:
- Users tab with policy actions: ban, unban, blackhole, and leave.
- Identities tab with join status and identity lifecycle checks.
- Routing tab for live destination table inspection.
- Filter and paging tools for high-density environments.

Use this page to enforce access posture, inspect identity state, and verify routing-level connectivity.
