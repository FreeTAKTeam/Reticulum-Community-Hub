[Topics // Signal Matrix]

Purpose:
This page manages the topic hierarchy and subscription routing model.

Primary systems:
- Topic Hierarchy Tree for branch navigation and focus.
- Topics tab for creating, editing, and deleting topic definitions.
- Subscribers tab for creating, editing, and deleting subscriber routes.
- Branch-aware filtering to isolate one path of the signal tree.

Use this page to shape message routing, maintain taxonomy discipline, and control how traffic fans out through the hub.
