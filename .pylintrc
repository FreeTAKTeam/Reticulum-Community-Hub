# The LXMF daemon code is vendored from upstream and intentionally diverges
# from our style guidelines, so skip it during lint runs.
# The embedded LXMF wrappers, reticulum_server entrypoints, and test suite rely
# on extensive runtime wiring that is not Pylint-friendly, so we lint the
# actively maintained packages by default. The telemetry pipeline currently
# mirrors upstream implementations and will be refactored separately.
